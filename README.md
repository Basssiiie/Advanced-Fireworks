# Advanced Fireworks
Small SA-MP script that allows players to spawn and fire fireworks in the server.

This script "requires" the Streamer Plugin, which you can download [here](http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=102865). If you really don't want to use the Streamer Plugin, you can download the source code and set the USE_STREAMER value to false. Recompile it and the script will use the default SA-MP functions. 

To see the script in action, you can watch this video from 2011: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm9dfnIMN2U

## Commands
| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/firework` | Opens the fireworks menu. |
| `/fireworks` | Same as `/firework`. |

After the player put down the first firework item, they will get a detonator to start the show. The player can also put down more firework items to make a bigger show.
