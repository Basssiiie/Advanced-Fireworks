# Advanced-Fireworks
Small SA-MP script that allows players to spawn and fire fireworks in the server.

See it in action in this video from 2011: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm9dfnIMN2U

## Commands
| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/firework` | Opens the fireworks menu. |
| `/fireworks` | Same as `/firework`. |

After the player put down the first firework item, they will get a detonator to start the show. The player can also put down more firework items to make a bigger show.
